## Project Synopsis

The aim of this project is to introduce JavaScript in the browser.  It is to be a simple implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors that can be played in the browser console.  A version with a graphical interface is currently out of scope and will follow later.

## Learning Objectives

This project is focused around breaking down problems and introducing very basic JavaScript.  There has been a basic overall plan provided, however implementation details are for me to flesh out.
