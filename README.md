## Project Synopsis

The aim of this project is to introduce JavaScript in the browser.  It is to be a simple implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors that can be played in the browser console.  A version with a web UI followed on later to help demonstrate DOM manipulation.

## Learning Objectives

This project is focused around breaking down problems and introducing very basic JavaScript.  There has been a basic overall plan provided, however implementation details are for me to flesh out.  Later on DOM manipulation is introduced, requiring a code refactor to enable both browser and console versions of the game to be played.
